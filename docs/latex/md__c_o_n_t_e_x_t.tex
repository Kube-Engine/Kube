This section will explain the context and motivations behind the creation of the Kube framework. We will take a tour of the different software development environments before concluding what this framework aims to be good at. Please note that everything is {\bfseries{only my opinion}} and my perception of the software engine market.\hypertarget{md__c_o_n_t_e_x_t_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{Inspiration}\label{md__c_o_n_t_e_x_t_autotoc_md1}
After working for 3 years as a software architect, I was very used to \href{https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtquick-index.html}{\texttt{ Qt Quick}} and its \href{https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtqml-index.html}{\texttt{ Q\+ML language}} in my daily job. Qt is an awesome framework but have too many weakness on intrusiveness, performance and its wide range of ways to accomplish simple tasks. After 3 attempts to re-\/create a Qt-\/\+Quick-\/like framework (\href{https://github.com/MatthieuMv/openApp}{\texttt{ here is the last}}) from scratch, I finally got the necessary metaprogramming, multithreading and data-\/oriented design skills to make a real-\/world framework using an interpreted language that would mix perfectly with C++.\hypertarget{md__c_o_n_t_e_x_t_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{Types of software development environments}\label{md__c_o_n_t_e_x_t_autotoc_md2}

These frameworks are often simple, efficient and allow you to control the architecture of your software.\hypertarget{md__c_o_n_t_e_x_t_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysubsubsection{$<$strong$>$\+S\+D\+L$<$/strong$>$, for 2\+D applications and games\+:}\label{md__c_o_n_t_e_x_t_autotoc_md4}

Easy to learn and master  &C code isn\textquotesingle{}t safe but still easy to encapsulate   \\\cline{1-2}
Lowest abstraction cost  &You will have to code a lot more to get modern features   \\\cline{1-2}
No specific I\+DE / editor  &For 3D, you must deal with an A\+PI like Open\+GL / Vulkan   \\\cline{1-2}
You control the game architecture  &\\\cline{1-2}
Very efficient  &\\\cline{1-2}
You can code on anything that can compile C and run a text editor  &\\\cline{1-2}
Runs on everything capable of 2D graphics on earth  &\\\cline{1-2}
Good documentation and quality online contents  &\\\cline{1-2}

Intuitive abstractions  &Easy to mess, hard to master   \\\cline{1-2}
Abstract most common parts of any software  &Abstractions doesn\textquotesingle{}t let much control to the user   \\\cline{1-2}
You can code in your favorite setup since you can avoid Qt\+Creator to compile  &Qt\+Creator is buggy and has a very poor user experience compared to V\+S\+Code   \\\cline{1-2}
Can release for a very large variety of old and new devices  &User is forced to adopt event driven development pattern for its architecture   \\\cline{1-2}
Q\+ML is very good to manage user interface / inputs and non-\/critical event binding; it also allow a clear separation between front-\/end, middle-\/end and back-\/end  &Gigabytes of libraries to download   \\\cline{1-2}
Signal / Slot is a great pattern to expose functionalities of a class without adding dependencies (only for non-\/critical paths)  &Q\+ML\textquotesingle{}s Java\+Script engine is very confusing when dealing with C++ code and classes   \\\cline{1-2}
Best documentation and a lot of quality online contents  &Few unexpected behaviors from an user perspective that slow you down   \\\cline{1-2}

These environments are often the combination of a framework and an editor. The framework tries to abstract as many features related to software / game development.\hypertarget{md__c_o_n_t_e_x_t_autotoc_md8}{}\doxysubsubsection{$<$strong$>$\+Unreal engine$<$/strong$>$, for 3\+D games only}\label{md__c_o_n_t_e_x_t_autotoc_md8}

Good for beginners who wish to have quick results  &Easy to mess, hard to master   \\\cline{1-2}
Abstract most common parts of any 3D game  &Very poor editor user experience\+: crashs, features poorly implemented (ex\+: global undo), a pain to get it running on linux and don\textquotesingle{}t expect it to run on low-\/spec computers   \\\cline{1-2}
Great cross-\/platform capabilities  &You must use a lot of high-\/level / high-\/cost intrusive abstractions and have not much control over the architecture of your game   \\\cline{1-2}
&Very bad for 2D graphics and UI design compared to S\+DL and Qt Quick   \\\cline{1-2}
